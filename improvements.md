# Improvements

- We can use a better storage strategy for the tokens which is more secure.
- Instead of using the credentials from the credentials.json file, we may use a .env file to provide the credentials in the application
- Making the application do the auto responding for multiple users at a time. We can also let the users customise the vacation message through a UI.
- Instead of having a single try catch block, we may use them extensively for more granular error handling.
- Code comments can be better giving reader a better idea of the code functioning
- We may add more logs to the application that will give us a better debugging experience
